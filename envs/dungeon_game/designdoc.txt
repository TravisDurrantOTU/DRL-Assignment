In simplest terms, a player roams a generated dungeon until they find the exit
They'll obviously have a health stat, unsure of what else
    Can collect items? Maybe. If I make it too complicated it will take too long to train.
Dungeon will have traps, treasure (gold), maybe enemies?
Rooms should be randomly generated and stored so that they can be revisited
    Will start by hardcoding a dungeon design (or at least hardcoding a seed) so that I can train something worth looking at
